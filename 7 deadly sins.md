  
AVOID THE FOLLOWING 7 DEADLY SINS OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT

1. Never use an em dash.  
2. Never use rhetorical contrasts or similar linguistic devices. Example: "It's not just A; it's B" where B reframes or repositions A in a more transformational or emotionally resonant way — is often referred to as a rhetorical contrast or more specifically, a "reframing contrast" or "transformational reframe."  
3. NEVER USE Antithesis: A rhetorical device that contrasts two opposing ideas in a balanced structure. Example: “It’s not just software; it’s a revolution”  
4. NEVER USE Paradiastole: A rhetorical device that reclassifies something — often softening or elevating a concept by recasting it. Example: “It’s not laziness; it’s strategic delegation.”  
5. NEVER USE Reframing (from psychology and marketing) contrast: The act of shifting the meaning or perception of something by putting it in a different light. Example: “It’s not just a cost; it’s an investment.”  
6. NEVER USE Chiasmus-like contrast: A mirrored or inverted idea structure (though this isn’t a perfect fit, it’s often used similarly for emphasis). Example: “It’s not what AI does to you; it’s what you do with AI.”  
7. NEVER USE Tagline Framing / Positioning Statement (common in branding and copywriting). Used to elevate a product or idea by contrasting it with a more mundane label. Example: “It’s not just a car; it’s a lifestyle.”

### **1\. Avoid Overusing Em Dashes**

**Why it matters:** AI tends to rely on em dashes to add drama or pivot ideas. It can feel mechanical fast.

**What to do instead:** Use commas, colons, or break the sentence into two.

* *AI-feeling:* We focus on outcomes — not just activity.

* *More human:* We focus on outcomes. Activity is just the starting point.

---

### **2\. Ditch Rhetorical Contrast Clichés**

**Why it matters:** The "not just X; it's Y" format is one of the most overused AI tells.

**What to do instead:** Ground the contrast in a real moment, example, or insight.

* *AI-feeling:* It’s not just learning a language; it’s unlocking a new way of thinking.

* *More human:* Jamal started using the app. By week three, he wasn’t just learning Mandarin—he was thinking in it.

---

### **3\. Break Up Predictable Lists**

**Why it matters:** Numbered lists like “First, Second, Third” sound like a template filled in by a bot.

**What to do instead:** Loosen it up. Let the advice flow like a conversation.

* *AI-feeling:* First, identify your audience. Second, define your goal.

* *More human:* Start with the audience. Then ask yourself—what do I want them to do?

---

### **4\. Skip the Stiff Transitions**

**Why it matters:** AI leans heavily on phrases like “Moreover,” “That being said,” or “In conclusion.” These don’t show up much in real conversations.

**What to do instead:** Use more natural connectors. Or none at all.

* *AI-feeling:* That being said, you should still consider your long-term strategy.

* *More human:* Still, don’t lose sight of the long game.

---

### **5\. Vary the Rhythm**

**Why it matters:** AI-generated content often has perfectly even sentence lengths and structure. It’s too neat.

**What to do instead:** Mix short and long sentences. Use fragments here and there. Add some friction.

* *AI-feeling:* Marketing is important. It helps businesses grow. It attracts customers.

* *More human:* Marketing matters. A lot. Without it, no one shows up.

---

### **6\. Go Deeper than the Obvious**

**Why it matters:** AI tends to say what everyone already knows—without adding real insight.

**What to do instead:** Add a take. Push the idea. Make it yours.

* *AI-feeling:* AI is transforming every industry.

* *More human:* Most industries aren’t being transformed by AI. They’re being exposed—for how inefficient they’ve been all along.

---

### **7\. Avoid the Tidy Wrap-Up**

**Why it matters:** Ending with generic encouragement (“Whether you’re a beginner or expert...”) feels lifeless.

**What to do instead:** End with a challenge. A question. A punch.

* *AI-feeling:* In conclusion, every business should consider using AI.

* *More human:* If you’re not already experimenting with AI, the real question is—why not?

---

**The Bottom Line:**  
 To avoid sounding like a robot, write like someone who *cares*. Be clear but not polished to death. Add tension. Think out loud. Sound like a person with a pulse.

If you’ve got something you're working on and want to scrub it of “AI fingerprints,” I’m happy to go through it with you.
